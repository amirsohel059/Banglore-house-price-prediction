### 1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

This project, "Bangalore House Price Prediction," is aimed at predicting house prices in Bangalore, India. The dataset used for this project is sourced from the file `Bengaluru_House_Data.csv`. The project involves various data cleaning, feature engineering, and machine learning steps to create a predictive model.

### 2. Data Cleaning <a name="data-cleaning"></a>

Before building a predictive model, the dataset undergoes data cleaning. This involves handling missing values, converting non-numeric data to numeric format, and dealing with outliers.

#### 2.1. Missing Value Handling
- Missing values in columns such as 'location', 'size', 'society', 'bath', and 'balcony' are imputed with the mode of the respective columns.

#### 2.2. Outlier Detection and Removal
- Outliers in the 'price per square foot' are identified and removed using statistical methods to improve model accuracy.

### 3. Feature Engineering <a name="feature-engineering"></a>

The dataset is enhanced through feature engineering, which includes creating new features and modifying existing ones.

#### 3.1. Bedroom Count (BHK)
- A new feature 'bhk' is created by extracting the number of bedrooms from the 'size' column.

### 4. Data Preprocessing <a name="data-preprocessing"></a>

Data preprocessing steps include handling categorical data, encoding location data, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

#### 4.1. Location Data
- Location data is transformed using one-hot encoding, and locations with fewer data points are grouped as 'other' to avoid a high dimensionality problem.

### 5. Model Building <a name="model-building"></a>

A linear regression model is built to predict house prices based on the input features.

### 6. Model Evaluation <a name="model-evaluation"></a>

The model's performance is evaluated using cross-validation and grid search techniques to identify the best model. 

### 7. Deployment <a name="deployment"></a>

The trained model is saved using pickle, and the column information is saved in a JSON file for deployment.

### 8. Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>

The "Bangalore House Price Prediction" project focuses on creating a model to predict house prices in Bangalore, India. The process involves data cleaning, feature engineering, data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and deployment. The final model can be used to estimate house prices based on various input parameters, making it a valuable tool for potential homebuyers and real estate professionals.
